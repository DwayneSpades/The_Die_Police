  - LAZY LARRY - UNDERWORLD UNDERLING
  - 'Well look who it is. '
  - Here I was thinking we'd seen the last of you.
  - You did cost us a lot of money, after all... Dante hasn't forgotten, that's for
    sure.
  - Well, since you're here... how about a game of scoops?
  - You still remember how to play, don't you?
  - First, we bet some cash.
  - Then, we each role a die.
  - If the total of our roles is greater then 6, first person to scoop wins the cash
    the other person bet.
  - If the total of our roles is 6 or less, then don't scoop. Otherwise, you lose
    the cash you bet.
  - Here, let's try a couple practice rounds.
