  dialogue:
  - Now here I was, unwinding after a long day of good business...
  - And now... here you are.
  - Looks like I'll be spending my evening dealing with a poor pup.
  - You know what your problem was, friend?
  - You didn't know how to take risks.
  - That was your failing. That was also why you could never beat me at scoops.
  - Now I could have my boys beat you senseless, send you home without any cash...
  - or, maybe not send you home at all...
  - But I need to drive the point home.
  - You still don't know how to take risks. Not like me.
  - You lack discipline -- punishment -- This scar on my nose has taught me enough
    to take on the federal government.
  - That's why I'm going to beat you through scoops, and watch you crumple.
