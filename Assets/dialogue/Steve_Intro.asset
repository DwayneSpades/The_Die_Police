  - SLEAZY STEVE - THE BOMBADILL GANG TRICKSTER
  - So you're the guy Dante's always talking about.
  - Allow me to introduce myself. They call me Sleazy Steve, but you can call me
    Steve.
  - Tricks, pick-ups, and stick-ups, that's me.
  - Heard you got Larry incarcerated. All by playing a couple games of scoops.
  - You know, I fancy myself quite the scoops player.
